# Pulldown Resister: An Automatic Face Mask Raiser
_developed by Seth May_

## Executive Summary
Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, it is in the interest of public health that people wear face masks or coverings inside to
reduce the spread of the virus. 
Sometimes people forget to pull their mask off their chin when they go inside. They might also be physically unable to do
so, either due to a disability or because their hands are filled.
I propose the Pulldown Resister, a device that automatically detects when a person goes inside and pulls up their mask.
This device improves mask adherence in public, while also offering an aid to those whom it may be difficult to manually
raise their mask
